        <h3>Early Life : </h3>

        <p>
            Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in what is now Croatia to 
            Serbian parents Milutin and Djuka Tesla. His father was a priest, 
            an intellectual who prodded his son to develop unusual mental discipline. His mother w
            as an inventor of many time-saving devices used for domestic tasks. Despite his early success at scho
            ol and obvious interest in experimenting with mechanical devices, Teslaâ€™s father was determined that young Nik
            ola become a minister. Only after Tesla sank into an acute physical decline did his 
            father relent and allow him to continue his scientific education at Graz Polytechnic Institute in Austria.
