<b><p style="color:white;font-family:cursive;font-size:30;"> About Our Making Style: </p></b>
<i><p style="color:white;font-size:20px;">It was founded in 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports by Bill Bowerman, 
    a track-and-field coach at the University of Oregon, and her former student Phil Knight. They opened their first retail outlet in 
    1966 and launched the Nike brand shoe in 1972. The company was renamed Nike, Inc., in 1978 and went public two years later</p></i><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<b><p style="color:white;;font-family:cursive;font-size:30;"> Our Founder's Story: </p></b><br><br><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/startbusinessjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2427DD03-3206-4307-9863-A010425CB3B3.jpeg?fit=750%2C422&ssl=1" alt="Nike Founder"></p>
<i><p style="color:white;font-size:22px;">The year is 1962 and Phil Knight had just graduated from Stanford. As any business graduate
    can tell you, becoming an entrepreneur is difficult if you don’t have any good ideas, but Phil had one.
    He was a distance runner back in university and in one of his business classes he had written a paper proposing the following idea. Phil had seen how Japanese cameras had replaced the dominant German cameras
     in the American market, and he wondered whether Japanese shoes could do the same to Puma and Adidas, which were at the time extremely popular in America. <br><br><br> But back to Phil. 
     After writing that paper and graduating, Phil became 
     obsessed with his idea about bringing Japanese shoes to the USA. Of course,
     he didn’t actually own any Japanese running shoes and the few he had seen were brought stateside by soldiers who had been stationed in Japan during the Occupation after the Second World War.<br><br><br>
     In November 1999, he flew over to Japan like a tourist and just started exploring. In the beautiful city of Kobe he stumbled upon a shoe store that caught his eye. It belonged to a company called Onitsuka
      Tiger and the shoes they made were (for their time) very high quality, so much so that Phil was determined to import them back home. </p>
